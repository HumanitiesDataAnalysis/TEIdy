  <p>I apologize in advance for this burdening of telegraphic channel; but
  questions involved are of such urgent importance, particularly in view
  of recent events, that our answers to them, if they deserve attention at
  all, seem to me to deserve it at once. There follows</p>
  <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Part 1: Basic Features of Post War
  Soviet Outlook, as Put Forward by Official Propaganda Machine, Are
  as Follows:</hi>
  <list>
    <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
    <item>USSR still lives in antagonistic “capitalist encirclement”
    with which in the long run there can be no permanent peaceful
    coexistence. As stated by Stalin in 1927 to a delegation of
    American workers: <quote rend="blockquote">
    <p>“In course of further development of international
    revolution there will emerge two centers of world
    significance: a socialist center, drawing to itself the
    countries which tend toward socialism, and a capitalist
    center, drawing to itself the countries that incline
    toward capitalism. Battle between these two centers for
    command of world economy will decide fate of capitalism
    and of communism in entire world.”</p>
    </quote></item>
    <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
    <item>Capitalist world is beset with internal conflicts, inherent in
    nature of capitalist society. These conflicts are insoluble by
    means of peaceful compromise. Greatest of them is that between
    England and US.</item>
    <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
    <item>Internal conflicts of capitalism inevitably generate wars.
    Wars thus generated may be of two kinds: intra-capitalist wars
    between two capitalist states, and wars of intervention against
    socialist world. Smart capitalists, vainly seeking escape from
    inner conflicts of capitalism, incline toward latter.</item>
    <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
    <item>Intervention against USSR, while it would be disastrous to
    those who undertook it, would cause renewed delay in progress of
    Soviet socialism and must therefore be forestalled at all
    costs.</item>
    <label>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>)</label>
    <item>Conflicts between capitalist states, though likewise fraught
    with danger for USSR, nevertheless hold out great possibilities
    for advancement of socialist cause, particularly if USSR remains
    militarily powerful, ideologically monolithic and faithful to
    its present brilliant leadership.</item>
    <label>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>)</label>
    <item>It must be borne in mind that capitalist world is not all bad.
    In addition to hopelessly reactionary and bourgeois elements, it
    includes (1) certain wholly enlightened and positive elements
    united in acceptable communistic parties and (2) certain other
    elements (now described for tactical reasons as progressive or
    democratic) whose reactions, aspirations and activities happen
    to be “objectively” favorable to interests of USSR. These last
    must be encouraged and utilized for Soviet purposes.</item>
    <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0712"/>
    <label>(<hi rend="italic">g</hi>)</label>
    <item>Among negative elements of bourgeois-capitalist society, most
    dangerous of all are those whom Lenin called false friends of
    the people, namely moderate-socialist or social-democratic
    leaders (in other words, non-Communist left-wing). These are
    more dangerous than out-and-out reactionaries, for latter at
    least march under their true colors, whereas moderate left-wing
    leaders confuse people by employing devices of socialism to
    serve interests of reactionary capital.</item>
  </list></p>
  <p>So much for premises. To what deductions do they lead from standpoint of
  Soviet policy? To following: <list>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
  <item>Everything must be done to advance relative strength of USSR
  as factor in international society. Conversely, no opportunity
  must be missed to reduce strength and influence, collectively as
  well as individually, of capitalist powers.</item>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
  <item>Soviet efforts, and those of Russia’s friends abroad, must be
  directed toward deepening and exploiting of differences and
  conflicts between capitalist powers. If these eventually deepen
  into an “imperialist” war, this war must be turned into
  revolutionary upheavals within the various capitalist
  countries.</item>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
  <item>“Democratic-progressive” elements abroad are to be utilized to
  maximum to bring pressure to bear on capitalist governments
  along lines agreeable to Soviet interests.</item>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
  <item>Relentless battle must be waged against socialist and
  social-democratic leaders abroad.</item>
  </list></p>
  <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Part</hi> 2: <hi rend="italic"
  >Background of Outlook</hi></p>
  <p>Before examining ramifications of this party line in practice there are
  certain aspects of it to which I wish to draw attention.</p>
  <p>First, it does not represent natural outlook of Russian people. Latter
  are, by and large, friendly to outside world, eager for experience of
  it, eager to measure against it talents they are conscious of
  possessing, eager above all to live in peace and enjoy fruits of their
  own labor. Party line only represents thesis which official propaganda
  machine puts forward with great skill and persistence to a public often
  remarkably resistant in the stronghold of its innermost thoughts. But
  party line is binding for outlook and conduct of people who make up
  apparatus of power—party, secret police and Government—and it is
  exclusively with these that we have to deal.</p>
  <p>Second, please note that premises on which this party line is based are
  for most part simply not true. Experience has shown that peaceful and
  mutually profitable coexistence of capitalist and socialist states is
  entirely possible. Basic internal conflicts in advanced countries are no
  longer primarily those arising out of capitalist ownership of means of
  production, but are ones arising from advanced urbanism and
  industrialism as such, which Russia has thus far been spared not by <pb
  n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0713"/>socialism but only by her own
  backwardness. Internal rivalries of capitalism do not always generate
  wars; and not all wars are attributable to this cause. To speak of
  possiblity of intervention against USSR today, after elimination of
  Germany and Japan and after example of recent war, is sheerest nonsense.
  If not provoked by forces of intolerance and subversion “capitalist”
  world of today is quite capable of living at peace with itself and with
  Russia. Finally, no sane person has reason to doubt sincerity of
  moderate socialist leaders in Western countries. Nor is it fair to deny
  success of their efforts to improve conditions for working population
  whenever, as in Scandinavia, they have been given chance to show what
  they could do.</p>
  <p>Falseness of these premises, every one of which pre-dates recent war, was
  amply demonstrated by that conflict itself. Anglo-American differences
  did not turn out to be major differences of Western World. Capitalist
  countries, other than those of Axis, showed no disposition to solve
  their differences by joining in crusade against USSR. Instead of
  imperialist war turning into civil wars and revolution, USSR found
  itself obliged to fight side by side with capitalist powers for an
  avowed community of aims.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, all these theses, however baseless and disproven, are being
  boldly put forward again today. What does this indicate? It indicates
  that Soviet party line is not based on any objective analysis of
  situation beyond Russia’s borders; that it has, indeed, little to do
  with conditions outside of Russia; that it arises mainly from basic
  inner-Russian necessities which existed before recent war and exist
  today.</p>
  <p>At bottom of Kremlin’s neurotic view of world affairs is traditional and
  instinctive Russian sense of insecurity. Originally, this was insecurity
  of a peaceful agricultural people trying to live on vast exposed plain
  in neighborhood of fierce nomadic peoples. To this was added, as Russia
  came into contact with economically advanced West, fear of more
  competent, more powerful, more highly organized societies in that area.
  But this latter type of insecurity was one which afflicted rather
  Russian rulers than Russian people; for Russian rulers have invariably
  sensed that their rule was relatively archaic in form, fragile and
  artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison
  or contact with political systems of Western countries. For this reason
  they have always feared foreign penetration, feared direct contact
  between Western world and their own, feared what would happen if
  Russians learned truth about world without or if foreigners learned
  truth about world within. And they have learned to seek security only in
  patient but deadly struggle for total destruction of rival power, never
  in compacts and compromises with it.</p>
  <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0714"/>
  <p>It was no coincidence that Marxism, which had smouldered ineffectively
  for half a century in Western Europe, caught hold and blazed for first
  time in Russia. Only in this land which had never known a friendly
  neighbor or indeed any tolerant equilibrium of separate powers, either
  internal or international, could a doctrine thrive which viewed economic
  conflicts of society as insoluble by peaceful means. After establishment
  of Bolshevist regime, Marxist dogma, rendered even more truculent and
  intolerant by Lenin’s interpretation, became a perfect vehicle for sense
  of insecurity with which Bolsheviks, even more than previous Russian
  rulers, were afflicted. In this dogma, with its basic altruism of
  purpose, they found justification for their instinctive fear of outside
  world, for the dictatorship without which they did not know how to rule,
  for cruelties they did not dare not to inflict, for sacrifices they felt
  bound to demand. In the name of Marxism they sacrificed every single
  ethical value in their methods and tactics. Today they cannot dispense
  with it. It is fig leaf of their moral and intellectual respectability.
  Without it they would stand before history, at best, as only the last of
  that long succession of cruel and wasteful Russian rulers who have
  relentlessly forced country on to ever new heights of military power in
  order to guarantee external security of their internally weak regimes.
  This is why Soviet purposes must always be solemnly clothed in trappings
  of Marxism, and why no one should underrate importance of dogma in
  Soviet affairs. Thus Soviet leaders are driven [by?] necessities of
  their own past and present position to put forward a dogma which
  [apparent omission] outside world as evil, hostile and menacing, but as
  bearing within itself germs of creeping disease and destined to be
  wracked with growing internal convulsions until it is given final <hi
  rend="italic">coup de grace</hi> by rising power of socialism and
  yields to new and better world. This thesis provides justification for
  that increase of military and police power of Russian state, for that
  isolation of Russian population from outside world, and for that fluid
  and constant pressure to extend limits of Russian police power which are
  together the natural and instinctive urges of Russian rulers. Basically
  this is only the steady advance of uneasy Russian nationalism, a
  centuries old movement in which conceptions of offense and defense are
  inextricably confused. But in new guise of international Marxism, with
  its honeyed promises to a desperate and war torn outside world, it is
  more dangerous and insidious than ever before.</p>
  <p>It should not be thought from above that Soviet party line is necessarily
  disingenuous and insincere on part of all those who put it forward. Many
  of them are too ignorant of outside world and mentally too dependent to
  question [apparent omission] self-hypnotism, <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701"
  facs="0715"/>and who have no difficulty making themselves believe
  what they find it comforting and convenient to believe. Finally we have
  the unsolved mystery as to who, if anyone, in this great land actually
  receives accurate and unbiased information about outside world. In
  atmosphere of oriental secretiveness and conspiracy which pervades this
  Government, possibilities for distorting or poisoning sources and
  currents of information are infinite. The very disrespect of Russians
  for objective truth—indeed, their disbelief in its existence—leads them
  to view all stated facts as instruments for furtherance of one ulterior
  purpose or another. There is good reason to suspect that this Government
  is actually a conspiracy within a conspiracy; and I for one am reluctant
  to believe that Stalin himself receives anything like an objective
  picture of outside world. Here there is ample scope for the type of
  subtle intrigue at which Russians are past masters. Inability of foreign
  governments to place their case squarely before Russian policy
  makers—extent to which they are delivered up in their relations with
  Russia to good graces of obscure and unknown advisers whom they never
  see and cannot influence—this to my mind is most disquieting feature of
  diplomacy in Moscow, and one which Western statesmen would do well to
  keep in mind if they would understand nature of difficulties encountered
  here.</p>
  <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Part 3: Projection of Soviet Outlook
  in Practical Policy on Official Level</hi></p>
  <p>We have now seen nature and background of Soviet program. What may we
  expect by way of its practical implementation?</p>
  <p>Soviet policy, as Department implies in its query under reference, is
  conducted on two planes: (1) official plane represented by actions
  undertaken officially in name of Soviet Government; and (2) subterranean
  plane of actions undertaken by agencies for which Soviet Government does
  not admit responsibility.</p>
  <p>Policy promulgated on both planes will be calculated to serve basic
  policies (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)
  outlined in part 1. Actions taken on different planes will differ
  considerably, but will dovetail into each other in purpose, timing and
  effect.</p>
  <p>On official plane we must look for following: <list>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
  <item>Internal policy devoted to increasing in every way strength
  and prestige of Soviet state: intensive
  military-industrialization; maximum development of armed forces;
  great displays to impress outsiders; continued secretiveness
  about internal matters, designed to conceal weaknesses and to
  keep opponents in dark.</item>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
  <item>Wherever it is considered timely and promising, efforts will
  be made to advance official limits of Soviet power. For the
  moment, these efforts are restricted to certain neighboring
  points conceived of here <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0716"
  />as being of immediate strategic necessity, such as Northern
  Iran, Turkey, possibly Bornholm. However, other points may at
  any time come into question, if and as concealed Soviet
  political power is extended to new areas. Thus a “friendly”
  Persian Government might be asked to grant Russia a port on
  Persian Gulf. Should Spain fall under Communist control,
  question of Soviet base at Gibraltar Strait might be activated.
  But such claims will appear on official level only when
  unofficial preparation is complete.</item>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
  <item>Russians will participate officially in international
  organizations where they sec opportunity of extending Soviet
  power or of inhibiting or diluting power of others. Moscow sees
  in <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> not the mechanism for a
  permanent and stable world society founded on mutual interest
  and aims of all nations, but an arena in which aims just
  mentioned can be favorably pursued. As long as <gloss
  target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> is considered here to serve
  this purpose, Soviets will remain with it. But if at any time
  they come to conclusion that it is serving to embarrass or
  frustrate their aims for power expansion and if they see better
  prospects for pursuit of these aims along other lines, they will
  not hesitate to abandon <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss>.
  This would imply, however, that they felt themselves strong
  enough to split unity of other nations by their withdrawal, to
  render <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> ineffective as a
  threat to their aims or security, and to replace it with an
  international weapon more effective from their viewpoint. Thus
  Soviet attitude toward <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> will
  depend largely on loyalty of other nations to it, and on degree
  of vigor, decisiveness and cohesion with which these nations
  defend in <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> the peaceful and
  hopeful concept of international life, which that organization
  represents to our way of thinking. I reiterate, Moscow has no
  abstract devotion to <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> ideals.
  Its attitude to that organization will remain essentially
  pragmatic and tactical.</item>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
  <item>Toward colonial areas and backward or dependent peoples,
  Soviet policy, even on official plane, will be directed toward
  weakening of power and influence and contacts of advanced
  Western nations, on theory that in so far as this policy is
  successful, there will be created a vacuum which will favor
  Communist-Soviet penetration. Soviet pressure for participation
  in trusteeship arrangements thus represents, in my opinion, a
  desire to be in a position to complicate and inhibit exertion of
  Western influence at such points rather than to provide major
  channel for exerting of Soviet power. Latter motive is not
  lacking, but for this Soviets prefer to rely on other channels
  than official trusteeship arrangements. Thus we may expect to
  find Soviets asking for admission everywhere to trusteeship or
  similar arrangements and using levers thus acquired to weaken
  Western influence among such peoples.</item>
  <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0717"/>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>)</label>
  <item>Russians will strive energetically to develop Soviet
  representation in, and official ties with, countries in which
  they sense strong possibilities of opposition to Western centers
  of power. This applies to such widely separated points as
  Germany, Argentina, Middle Eastern countries, etc.</item>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>)</label>
  <item>In international economic matters, Soviet policy will really
  be dominated by pursuit of autarchy for Soviet Union and
  Soviet-dominated adjacent areas taken together. That, however,
  will be underlying policy. As far as official line is concerned,
  position is not yet clear. Soviet Government has shown strange
  reticence since termination hostilities on subject foreign
  trade. If large scale long term credits should be forthcoming, I
  believe Soviet Government may eventually again do lip service,
  as it did in 1930’s to desirability of building up international
  economic exchanges in general. Otherwise I think it possible
  Soviet foreign trade may be restricted largely to Soviet’s own
  security sphere, including occupied areas in Germany, and that a
  cold official shoulder may be turned to principle of general
  economic collaboration among nations.</item>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">g</hi>)</label>
  <item>With respect to cultural collaboration, lip service will
  likewise be rendered to desirability of deepening cultural
  contacts between peoples, but this will not in practice be
  interpreted in any way which could weaken security position of
  Soviet peoples. Actual manifestations of Soviet policy in this
  respect will be restricted to arid channels of closely
  shepherded official visits and functions, with superabundance of
  vodka and speeches and dearth of permanent effects.</item>
  <label>(<hi rend="italic">h</hi>)</label>
  <item>Beyond this, Soviet official relations will take what might be
  called “correct” course with individual foreign governments,
  with great stress being laid on prestige of Soviet Union and its
  representatives and with punctilious attention to protocol, as
  distinct from good manners.</item>
</list></p>
<p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Part 4: Following May Be Said as to
What We May Expect by Way of Implementation of Basic Soviet Policies
on Unofficial, or Subterranean Plane, i.e. on Plane for Which Soviet
Government Accepts no Responsibility</hi></p>
<p>Agencies utilized for promulgation of policies on this plane are
following: <list>
<label>1.</label>
<item>Inner central core of Communist Parties in other countries.
While many of persons who compose this category may also appear
and act in unrelated public capacities, they are in reality
working closely together as an underground operating directorate
of world communism, a concealed Comintern<note n="45"
xml:id="d475fn45">The Third (Communist) International,
founded by the Bolsheviks at Moscow in March 1919, announced
as having been dissolved in May 1943; see <ref

coordinated and directed <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0718"
/>by Moscow. It is important to remember that this inner core is
actually working on underground lines, despite legality of
parties with which it is associated.</item>
<label>2.</label>
<item>Rank and file of Communist Parties. Note distinction is drawn
between these and persons defined in paragraph 1. This
distinction has become much sharper in recent years. Whereas
formerly foreign Communist Parties represented a curious (and
from Moscow’s standpoint often inconvenient) mixture of
conspiracy and legitimate activity, now the conspiratorial
element has been neatly concentrated in inner circle and ordered
underground, while rank and file—no longer even taken into
confidence about realities of movement—are thrust forward as
bona fide internal partisans of certain political tendencies
within their respective countries, genuinely innocent of
conspiratorial connection with foreign states. Only in certain
countries where communists are numerically strong do they now
regularly appear and act as a body. As a rule they are used to
penetrate, and to influence or dominate, as case may be, other
organizations less likely to be suspected of being tools of
Soviet Government, with a view to accomplishing their purposes
through [apparent omission] organizations, rather than by direct
action as a separate political party.</item>
<label>3.</label>
<item>A wide variety of national associations or bodies which can be
dominated or influenced by such penetration. These include:
labor unions, youth leagues, women’s organizations, racial
societies, religious societies, social organizations, cultural
groups, liberal magazines, publishing houses, etc.</item>
<label>4.</label>
<item>International organizations which can be similarly penetrated
through influence over various national components. Labor, youth
and women’s organizations are prominent among them. Particular,
almost vital, importance is attached in this connection to
international labor movement. In this, Moscow sees possibility
of sidetracking western governments in world affairs and
building up international lobby capable of compelling
governments to take actions favorable to Soviet interests in
various countries and of paralyzing actions disagreeable to
USSR.</item>
<label>5.</label>
<item>Russian Orthodox Church, with its foreign branches, and
through it the Eastern Orthodox Church in general.</item>
<label>6.</label>
<item>Pan-Slav movement and other movements (Azerbaijan, Armenian,
Turcoman, etc.) based on racial groups within Soviet
Union.</item>
<label>7.</label>
<item>Governments or governing groups willing to lend themselves to
Soviet purposes in one degree or another, such as present
Bulgarian and Yugoslav Governments, North Persian regime,
Chinese Comunists, etc. Not only propaganda machines but actual
policies of these regimes can be placed extensively at disposal
of USSR.</item>
</list></p>
<pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0719"/>
<p>It may be expected that component parts of this far-flung apparatus will
be utilized, in accordance with their individual suitability, as
follows: <list>
<label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
<item>To undermine general political and strategic potential of
major western powers. Efforts will be made in such countries to
disrupt national self confidence, to hamstring measures of
national defense, to increase social and industrial unrest, to
stimulate all forms of disunity. All persons with grievances,
whether economic or racial, will be urged to seek redress not in
mediation and compromise, but in defiant violent struggle for
destruction of other elements of society. Here poor will be set
against rich, black against white, young against old, newcomers
against established residents, etc.</item>
<label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
<item>On unofficial plane particularly violent efforts will be made
to weaken power and influence of Western Powers of [<hi
rend="italic">on</hi>] colonial backward, or dependent
peoples. On this level, no holds will be barred. Mistakes and
weaknesses of western colonial administration will be
mercilessly exposed and exploited. Liberal opinion in Western
countries will be mobilized to weaken colonial policies.
Resentment among dependent peoples will be stimulated. And while
latter are being encouraged to seek independence of Western
Powers, Soviet dominated puppet political machines will be
undergoing preparation to take over domestic power in respective
colonial areas when independence is achieved.</item>
<label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
<item>Where individual governments stand in path of Soviet purposes
pressure will be brought for their removal from office. This can
happen where governments directly oppose Soviet foreign policy
aims (Turkey, Iran), where they seal their territories off
against Communist penetration (Switzerland, Portugal), or where
they compete too strongly, like Labor Government in England, for
moral domination among elements which it is important for
Communists to dominate. (Sometimes, two of these elements are
present in a single case. Then Communist opposition becomes
particularly shrill and savage.[)]</item>
<label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
<item>In foreign countries Communists will, as a rule, work toward
destruction of all forms of personal independence, economic,
political or moral. Their system can handle only individuals who
have been brought into complete dependence on higher power.
Thus, persons who are financially independent—such as individual
businessmen, estate owners, successful farmers, artisans and all
those who exercise local leadership or have local prestige, such
as popular local clergymen or political figures, are anathema.
It is not by chance that even in USSR local officials are kept
constantly on move from one job to another, to prevent their
taking root.</item>
<pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0720"/>
<label>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>)</label>
<item>Everything possible will be done to set major Western Powers
against each other. Anti-British talk will be plugged among
Americans, anti-American talk among British. Continentals,
including Germans, will be taught to abhor both Anglo-Saxon
powers. Where suspicions exist, they will be fanned; where not,
ignited. No effort will be spared to discredit and combat all
efforts which threaten to lead to any sort of unity or cohesion
among other [apparent omission] from which Russia might be
excluded. Thus, all forms of international organization not
amenable to Communist penetration and control, whether it be the
Catholic [apparent omission] international economic concerns, or
the international fraternity of royalty and aristocracy, must
expect to find themselves under fire from many, and often
[apparent omission].</item>
<label>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>)</label>
<item>In general, all Soviet efforts on unofficial international
plane will be negative and destructive in character, designed to
tear down sources of strength beyond reach of Soviet control.
This is only in line with basic Soviet instinct that there can
be no compromise with rival power and that constructive work can
start only when Communist power is dominant. But behind all this
will be applied insistent, unceasing pressure for penetration
and command of key positions in administration and especially in
police apparatus of foreign countries. The Soviet regime is a
police regime par excellence, reared in the dim half world of
Tsarist police intrigue, accustomed to think primarily in terms
of police power. This should never be lost sight of in gauging
Soviet motives.</item>

<p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Part 5:</hi> [<hi rend="italic"
>Practical Deductions From Standpoint of US Policy</hi>]</p>
<p>In summary, we have here a political force committed fanatically to the
belief that with US there can be no permanent <hi rend="italic">modus
vivendi</hi>, that it is desirable and necessary that the internal
harmony of our society be disrupted, our traditional way of life be
destroyed, the international authority of our state be broken, if Soviet
power is to be secure. This political force has complete power of
disposition over energies of one of world’s greatest peoples and
resources of world’s richest national territory, and is borne along by
deep and powerful currents of Russian nationalism. In addition, it has
an elaborate and far flung apparatus for exertion of its influence in
other countries, an apparatus of amazing flexibility and versatility,
managed by people whose experience and skill in underground methods are
presumably without parallel in history. Finally, it is seemingly
inaccessible to considerations of reality in its basic reactions. For
it, the vast fund of objective fact about human society is not, as with
us, the measure against which outlook is constantly being tested and
re-formed, but a grab bag from which individual items are selected
arbitrarily and <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0721"/>tendenciously
to bolster an outlook already preconceived. This is admittedly not a
pleasant picture. Problem of how to cope with this force in [<hi
rend="italic">is</hi>] undoubtedly greatest task our diplomacy has
ever faced and probably greatest it will ever have to face. It should be
point of departure from which our political general staff work at
present juncture should proceed. It should be approached with same
thoroughness and care as solution of major strategic problem in war, and
if necessary, with no smaller outlay in planning effort. I cannot
attempt to suggest all answers here. But I would like to record my
conviction that problem is within our power to solve—and that without
recourse to any general military conflict. And in support of this
conviction there are certain observations of a more encouraging nature I
should like to make: <list>
<label>(1)</label>
<item>Soviet power, unlike that of Hitlerite Germany, is neither
schematic nor adventuristic. It does not work by fixed plans. It
does not take unnecessary risks. Impervious to logic of reason,
and it is highly sensitive to logic of force. For this reason it
can easily withdraw—and usually does—when strong resistance is
encountered at any point. Thus, if the adversary has sufficient
force and makes clear his readiness to use it, he rarely has to
do so. If situations are properly handled there need be no
prestige-engaging showdowns.</item>
<label>(2)</label>
<item>Gauged against Western World as a whole, Soviets are still by
far the weaker force. Thus, their success will really depend on
degree of cohesion, firmness and vigor which Western World can
muster. And this is factor which it is within our power to
influence.</item>
<label>(3)</label>
<item>Success of Soviet system, as form of internal power, is not
yet finally proven. It has yet to be demonstrated that it can
survive supreme test of successive transfer of power from one
individual or group to another. Lenin’s death was first such
transfer, and its effects wracked Soviet state for 15 years.
After Stalin’s death or retirement will be second. But even this
will not be final test. Soviet internal system will now be
subjected, by virtue of recent territorial expansions, to series
of additional strains which once proved severe tax on Tsardom.
We here are convinced that never since termination of civil war
have mass of Russian people been emotionally farther removed
from doctrines of Communist Party than they are today. In
Russia, party has now become a great and—for the moment—highly
successful apparatus of dictatorial administration, but it has
ceased to be a source of emotional inspiration. Thus, internal
soundness and permanence of movement need not yet be regarded as
assured.</item>
<label>(4)</label>
<item>All Soviet propaganda beyond Soviet security sphere is
basically negative and destructive. It should therefore be
relatively easy to combat it by any intelligent and really
constructive program.</item>
</list></p>
<pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0722"/>
<p>For these reasons I think we may approach calmly and with good heart
problem of how to deal with Russia. As to how this approach should be
made, I only wish to advance, by way of conclusion, following comments: <list>
<label>(1)</label>
<item>Our first step must be to apprehend, and recognize for what it
is, the nature of the movement with which we are dealing. We
must study it with same courage, detachment, objectivity, and
same determination not to be emotionally provoked or unseated by
it, with which doctor studies unruly and unreasonable
individual.</item>
<label>(2)</label>
<item>We must see that our public is educated to realities of
Russian situation. I cannot over-emphasize importance of this.
Press cannot do this alone. It must be done mainly by
Government, which is necessarily more experienced and better
informed on practical problems involved. In this we need not be
deterred by [ugliness?] of picture. I am convinced that there
would be far less hysterical anti-Sovietism in our country today
if realities of this situation were better understood by our
people. There is nothing as dangerous or as terrifying as the
unknown. It may also be argued that to reveal more information
on our difficulties with Russia would reflect unfavorably on
Russian-American relations. I feel that if there is any real
risk here involved, it is one which we should have courage to
face, and sooner the better. But I cannot see what we would be
risking. Our stake in this country, even coming on heels of
tremendous demonstrations of our friendship for Russian people,
is remarkably small. We have here no investments to guard, no
actual trade to lose, virtually no citizens to protect, few
cultural contacts to preserve. Our only stake lies in what we
hope rather than what we have; and I am convinced we have better
chance of realizing those hopes if our public is enlightened and
if our dealings with Russians are placed entirely on realistic
and matter-of-fact basis.</item>
<label>(3)</label>
<item>Much depends on health and vigor of our own society. World
communism is like malignant parasite which feeds only on
diseased tissue. This is point at which domestic and foreign
policies meet. Every courageous and incisive measure to solve
internal problems of our own society, to improve
self-confidence, discipline, morale and community spirit of our
own people, is a diplomatic victory over Moscow worth a thousand
diplomatic notes and joint communiqués. If we cannot abandon
fatalism and indifference in face of deficiencies of our own
society, Moscow will profit—Moscow cannot help profiting by them
in its foreign policies.</item>
<label>(4)</label>
<item>We must formulate and put forward for other nations a much
more positive and constructive picture of sort of world we would
like to see than we have put forward in past. It is not enough
to urge people to develop political processes similar to our
own. Many foreign <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0723"
/>peoples, in Europe at least, are tired and frightened by
experiences of past, and are less interested in abstract freedom
than in security. They are seeking guidance rather than
responsibilities. We should be better able than Russians to give
them this. And unless we do, Russians certainly will.</item>
<label>(5)</label>
<item>Finally we must have courage and self-confidence to cling to
our own methods and conceptions of human society. After all, the
greatest danger that can befall us in coping with this problem
of Soviet communism, is that we shall allow ourselves to become
like those with whom we are coping.</item>
